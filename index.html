    type numbers in everytime we refresh the page.
    The id's are how we'll reach the value in the box
    in our javascript file. -->

    to check out our javascript file so that you know what
    actions to take. We put this at the bottom of the HTML and
    not the top in the head like we would if it were CSS because
    it's better for the loading time of our page. If you want,
    you can put it on the top of the top, it will work, but it's
    not recommended.  -->
