# basicjs
A quick intro to Javascript tutorial explaining basic programming concepts like comments, variables, control flow (if/then and for loops), and functions. 

## File Setup
To recreate this, just simply make a file called index.html and another called script.js and make sure they're in the same folder.

## Note: 
In this example there are 4 files: index.html and script.js are heavily commented for your understanding.
index2.html and script2.js are just the code.
