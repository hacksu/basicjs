# basicjs
A quick intro to Javascript tutorial explaining basic programming concepts like comments, variables, control flow (if/then and for loops), and functions. 

## What you'll learn
This tutorial goes over a few very basic, essential programming concepts in javascript including:
 - variables
 - comments
 - the console
 - flow control (if/then statements, for loops)
 - functions

## File Setup
To recreate this, just simply make a file called index.html and another called script.js and make sure they're in the same folder. Follow the tutorial.

In this example there are 4 files: index.html and script.js are heavily commented for your understanding.
index2.html and script2.js are just the code.
